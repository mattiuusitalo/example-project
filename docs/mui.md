# MUI

## Theme

Something about extending theme if you need some new variants?

## Layout

- RECOMMENDATION: Use flexbox for layout
- Something about using `Stack`

## Popover, popper, menu

- RECOMMENDATION: [material-ui-popup-state](https://github.com/jcoreio/material-ui-popup-state) is
a useful library to handle the state for these components.
